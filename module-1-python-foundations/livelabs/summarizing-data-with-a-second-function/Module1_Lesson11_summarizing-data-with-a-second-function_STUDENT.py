"""Summarizing Data With a Second Function
Module 1: Python Foundations

HOW TO RUN
    Open a terminal in the folder that holds this file (and any data
    file the code reads), then run:
        python3 Module1_Lesson11_summarizing-data-with-a-second-function_STUDENT.py
    Or make the file executable once:
        chmod +x Module1_Lesson11_summarizing-data-with-a-second-function_STUDENT.py
    and from then on run it directly:
        ./Module1_Lesson11_summarizing-data-with-a-second-function_STUDENT.py
    The first line, #!/usr/bin/env python3 (the "shebang"), is what
    makes ./ work: it names the program that runs this file.
    python3 <file> treats that line as a comment and ignores it.

Follow along: type each section as it comes up, then save and run the
file again after each section. Each section prints its own heading,
so you can tell which output belongs to which step.

Complete each TODO as you go. A ____ blank is not valid Python, so
fill it in before you run the file again.
